## Introduction of the Project

The project delves into the fascinating intersection of culinary art and data analysis. We aim to unearth patterns and insights that are not immediately apparent. Specifically, we focuses on understanding **how the number of ingredients in a recipe might influence its users' ratings**. 

Understanding the relationship between the number of ingredients in a recipe and its ratings is crucial for various reasons. It reveals consumer preferences, indicating whether simplicity or complexity is more valued in cooking. This insight is vital for chefs, recipe developers, and the food industry, as it guides recipe creation and menu planning, potentially influencing customer satisfaction and business success. Additionally, it offers home cooks guidance on popular recipe choices and can inform culinary education. For the health-conscious, it may also highlight trends in nutritional choices. Essentially, this analysis bridges culinary art with consumer behavior, enhancing our understanding of food preferences.

We collected our data from food.com, a renowned online platform that offers a vast collection of user-contributed recipes. This website has become a go-to resource for both amateur and professional cooks seeking culinary inspiration, recipe instructions, and nutritional information. The significance of sourcing data from food.com lies in its large user base and the diversity of recipes it hosts, which reflect a wide array of culinary tastes and preferences.

The data from food.com has divided into two seprated datasets: food_recipe and user_interactions. For the food_recipe dataset, some relevant columns to our projects are *recipe name*, *recipe id*, and*number of ingredients*
